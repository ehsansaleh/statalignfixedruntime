# statalignfixedruntime
Stat Align v3.2 with very slight changes for making it run for a certain amount of time
Stat Align is already published in http://statalign.github.io/ and https://github.com/statalign/statalign/. This version is just a replicate with the flexibility of running statalign for a certain amount of time using the -stop option implemented.
